# WPE depends on an MP3 decoder to support "audio beeps" as focus switches
# between elements in a browser based UI. Note that the mpg123 plug-in is not
# enabled by default as the mpg123 recipe is not in oe-core (as of jethro it's
# in meta-oe) and requires whitelisting as it sets the commercial license flag.
# Enabling mpg123 here is therefore an experimental change, to be reviewed...
